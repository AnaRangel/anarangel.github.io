For example, during flight selection, the total price is not clear, additional benefits are not visible and there is too much information about the plans that users often ignore. A critical point is that for flights to different time zones, such as Australia, the arrival date and time are not clear, which could lead to a customer missing their flight and thus losing the customer.",

  "latam_process_benchmark_desc": "I then compared some airlines and Airbnb that manage the same process, selected for their market relevance and simplicity.

  "latam_process_user_interview_desc_2": "Synthetic users found the ticket booking process confusing and overwhelming. They struggled to find clear and accurate arrival times at their destinations.
