# Protafolio UX Ana Rangel

## Description
Welcome üåü My name is Ana, and I'm a UX designer learning to program. I decided to undertake this project not only to create my own website and showcase my work, but also to learn how to program it. This is the first version with two sections (Home and About Me), but this page will continue to grow in the future. I chose to make it open source so that the community and anyone who wishes to contribute can feel free to do so. Obviously, those who collaborate will be acknowledged on my website ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Getting Started üèÅ

Before starting, here is the [figma with the website design.](https://www.figma.com/design/JZhuiA3nyNRSFWVsunpV4K/Website-Ana-Rangel?node-id=5-1513&t=HMYitHqo325FaatD-1)

Jumpstart your development with `astro-starter` by setting up your project environment. Here's how to get everything ready:

### üå† Create Your Repository from a Template

To make things super easy, we've set up `astro-starter` as a template repository. This means you can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the top right corner of the `astro-starter` GitHub page and click on "Use this template".
2. When the menu opens, click "Create new repository from template".
3. Fill in the repository name and description as you would for any other repo.

### Download Your Newly Created Repository

After creating your repository from the `astro-starter` template, download or clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git
cd <your-repository-name>
```

Replace <your-username> and <your-repository-name> with your GitHub username and the name of your newly created repository, respectively.

<summary>üöÄ Alternative: Clone the Repository</summary>

If you prefer to clone the repository directly, you can do so by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zyruks/astro-starter.git
cd astro-starter
```

</details>

### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have PNPM installed, then execute the following command within your project directory to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start Developing

Now that the dependencies are installed, initiate the development server to bring your project to life:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

You're all set! Dive into the code and start building something amazing with `astro-starter`. Happy coding!

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
